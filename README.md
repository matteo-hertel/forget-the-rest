# Forget the rest

This package was born out of the ungodly amount of time that I had to spend on the non code part of a hackathon day, I think a good couple of hours went into addding linting, prettier, gitignore, npm commands etc etc, all I wanted was a file I could add my code and have the same tools I use in my production projects "just working"

## North ‚≠ê

the north star is to provide one command that you can run in any empty folder will give you a good to go setup to write your code and have all the tools that you already use and love for free
